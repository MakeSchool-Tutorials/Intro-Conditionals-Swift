> Xcode 8 and Swift 3 was released on September 13th, 2016. Please make sure to update as soon as possible. [The first lesson](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/tutorial/getting-started-with-xcode-playgrounds-0afee09b-0bdb-47bd-8551-e179266b6b65/get-started-with-xcode-74d7476e-22f1-403c-99ab-b767f1a7b71e) has been updated with instructions for checking your version and updating if necessary.

How can you make your code smarter? Ideally, we should be able to change what happens based on conditions. In this playground you will program an adaptive cruise control system for a car. It will speed up and slow down based to avoid crashes on conditions you set!
